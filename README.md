Listens to the file system change notifications and raises events when a directory, or file in a directory, changes.
This can be very helpful to track file changes which are kept for third party use and will be updated at any point of time. Such as files to be imported once it is modified etc something like that.
Irrespective of any type of project (windows, web, mobile etc) this class can be useful anywhere.
